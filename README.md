## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm currently studying mathematics, artificial intelligence, and system design. I build to learn and I write to share.

If you're interested in AI engineering, technical writing, or collaborative projects, feel free to [connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-martinez-cuevas/) or explore my work!
